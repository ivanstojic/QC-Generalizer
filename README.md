# Generalizer

Generalizer is a time-based processor patch for Quartz Composer written in Objective-C.

Its purpose is to generate a configurable number of on-off outputs
that change in time. There are several configurable options which
affect the operation of the patch.


## Requirements

I developed this on OS X 10.7 using Xcode 4.2. Besides the usual OS X
development platform files, this patch requires no extra libraries.


## 32/64 bit support

This patch will work when compiled in either 32 or 64 bit modes.
